    "# Mixed Integer Programming Python (Pulp)\n",
    "https://medium.com/@gazalashaikh999/mixed-integer-programming-cfe0c196e875\n",
    "    \n",
    "Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) is a powerful optimization technique used to solve complex decision-making problems that involve a combination of continuous and discrete variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It finds applications in various domains, such as production planning, supply chain management, resource allocation, and scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will explore how to formulate and solve mixed integer programming problems using Python. We will utilize the PuLP library, a popular open-source linear programming modeling tool, to demonstrate the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear Programming Algorithm :\n",
    "Linear programming is an operations research technique used to determine the optimal solution in a mathematical model where the objective and constraints are expressed as a system of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Simplex Algorithm: The Simplex algorithm is one of the most well-known and widely used LP algorithms. It systematically moves from one vertex of the feasible region to another along the edges, optimizing the objective function at each step until an optimal solution is reached. It is efficient for solving LP problems with a moderate number of variables and constraints.\n",
    "+ Interior-Point Methods: Interior-point methods, also known as barrier methods, are iterative optimization algorithms that explore the interior of the feasible region rather than the vertices. They use barrier functions to ensure that the iterates remain within the feasible region. Interior-point methods are known for their efficiency in solving large-scale LP problems.\n",
    "+ Dual Simplex Algorithm: The Dual Simplex algorithm is a variant of the Simplex algorithm that operates on the dual LP problem. It starts with an initial feasible solution and iteratively improves it until an optimal solution is obtained. This algorithm is particularly useful when the number of constraints is large compared to the number of variables.\n",
    "+ Cutting-Plane Methods: Cutting-plane methods aim to solve LP problems by iteratively adding additional constraints, known as cutting planes, to tighten the feasible region. These cutting planes are derived from the LP problem’s dual problem or by generating valid inequalities. Cutting-plane methods can be effective for solving LP problems with a large number of variables and constraints.\n",
    "+ Ellipsoid Algorithm: The Ellipsoid algorithm is a theoretical LP algorithm that uses the ellipsoid method to iteratively shrink an ellipsoid around the optimal solution until it reaches the desired accuracy. While the Ellipsoid algorithm has good theoretical properties, it is not as efficient in practice compared to other LP algorithms.\n",
    "+ Interior-Point Cutting-Plane Methods: This class of algorithms combines the advantages of interior-point methods and cutting-plane methods. They use interior-point methods to obtain an approximate solution and then employ cutting planes to improve the solution iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "These LP algorithms vary in their approach, complexity, and efficiency for different problem instances. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific characteristics of the LP problem, such as the number of variables and constraints, sparsity of the problem, and desired accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integer Programming Algorithm :\n",
    "<i>Integer programming algorithms are optimization algorithms designed to solve integer programming (IP) problems, where the decision variables are required to take integer values.</i> These algorithms are specifically tailored to handle the additional complexity introduced by integer variables, as compared to linear programming (LP) problems where variables can take any real value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several key integer programming algorithms that have been developed over the years. Here are some of the commonly used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Branch and Bound: Branch and Bound is a widely used algorithm for solving integer programming problems. It systematically explores the solution space by partitioning it into smaller subproblems, bounding the optimal solution within each subproblem, and branching on promising regions of the solution space until an optimal integer solution is found.\n",
    "+ Cutting Plane: The Cutting Plane method enhances LP relaxations of IP problems by iteratively adding valid inequalities, known as cutting planes, to tighten the LP relaxation solution until it becomes an integer solution. This algorithm helps in reducing the search space efficiently.\n",
    "+ Branch and Cut: Branch and Cut is an extension of the Branch and Bound algorithm that incorporates the Cutting Plane method. It combines the benefits of both algorithms by using cutting planes to strengthen LP relaxations at each node of the branch and bound tree, leading to faster convergence towards the optimal integer solution.\n",
    "+ Branch and Price: Branch and Price is an algorithm suitable for solving IP problems with a large number of variables. It combines column generation and branching techniques to generate and evaluate promising columns (variables) iteratively, gradually building an optimal solution. It is particularly effective for problems with a large number of constraints.\n",
    "+ Dynamic Programming: Dynamic Programming can be applied to solve specific types of integer programming problems, such as knapsack problems, by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively. It takes advantage of overlapping subproblem structure to avoid redundant computations.\n",
    "+ Heuristic Algorithms: In addition to exact algorithms, various heuristic algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Tabu Search, are employed to find near-optimal solutions for large-scale integer programming problems within a reasonable computational time. These algorithms provide approximate solutions with good quality but do not guarantee optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some algorithms are more suitable for certain problem types or problem sizes. Implementations of these algorithms are available in various optimization libraries and software packages, such as PuLP, Gurobi, CPLEX, and SCIP, which provide efficient and robust solvers for integer programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s solve a Resource Allocation problem using the Python programming language and the PuLP library:"
